Let's take a look on the maximum element of the given array. Suddenly, this number is x (or y, the order doesn't matter). Okay, what would we do if we know x and merged list of divisors of x and y? Let's remove all divisors of x and see what we got. The maximum element in the remaining array is y. So, the problem is solved.
